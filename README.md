**Portugal Bank Marketing Dataset Analysis and Model Training**

Overview:

This README file provides information on the Portugal Bank Marketing Dataset, explores the data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and details the process of training multiple models to find the best accuracy using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

Dataset Information:

The Portugal Bank Marketing Dataset contains information about marketing campaigns related to banking products. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (binary classification: yes or no). The dataset includes various features such as client demographics, economic indicators, and previous campaign outcomes.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Before training models, it's crucial to understand the dataset. EDA is performed to gain insights into the distribution of variables, identify trends, and detect potential outliers. Visualizations and statistical summaries will be generated to facilitate a better understanding of the data.

Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE):

Imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outweighs the other, can lead to biased models. SMOTE is a technique used to address class imbalance by oversampling the minority class. This step is crucial to ensure that the models are trained on a balanced dataset, enhancing their ability to generalize to both classes.

Model Training

Multiple machine learning models will be trained using the preprocessed dataset. Common classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree will be considered. The models will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Conclusion:

The steps taken in exploring the Portugal Bank Marketing Dataset, applying SMOTE for class imbalance, and training multiple models to find the best accuracy. Users can refer to the accompanying code files for detailed implementation and analysis.
